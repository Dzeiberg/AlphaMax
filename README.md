# AlphaMax
Implementation of methods for estimating the class prior in the positive-unlabeled classification setting

## Requirements
 - deep learning toolbox
 - parallel computing toolbox

## How to run AlphaMax
The main function for running AlphaMax is [runAlphaMax](alphamax/runAlphaMax.m). See [testalphamax.m](tests/testalphamax.m) for an example of how to estimate the class priors of synthetically generated datasets.

## How to run DistCurve
The main function for running DistCurve is [runDistCurve](distcurve/runDistCurve.m). See [testdistcurve.m](tests/testdistcurve.m) for an example of how to use DistCurve to estimate the class priors of synthetically generated datasets.
